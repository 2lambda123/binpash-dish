# DiSh: Dynamic Shell-Script Distribution 

> _A system for scaling out POSIX shell scripts on distributed file systems._
> _Hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases/)._

DiSh builds heavily on and extends [PaSh](https://github.com/binpash/pash) (command annotations, compiler infrastructure, and JIT orchestration).

## Installation

On Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian run `./scripts/setup-dish.sh` to build DiSh and its dependencies.

__TODO:__ Is that enough? If there is anything else we should add it.


## Running DiSh

__TODO:__ Describe how to run a hello world script. See PaSh's README for inspiration.

## Repo Structure

This repo hosts most of the components of the `dish` development. Some of them are incorporated in [PaSh](https://github.com/binpash/pash) The structure is as follows:

* [pash](./pash): Contains the complete PaSh repo as a submodule. DiSh uses and extends its annotations, compiler, and JIT orchestration infrastructure.
* [evaluation](./evaluation): Shell scripts used for evaluation.
* [runtime](./runtime): Runtime component â€” e.g., remote fifo channels.
* [scripts](./scripts): Scripts related to installation, deployment, and continuous integration.

## Evaluation

__TODO:__ Describe how to run DiSh's evaluation (also setting up a cluster etc).
